      "Monica: And they weren't looking at you before?!\n",
      "Monica: Are you okay, sweetie?\n",
      "Monica: (explaining to the others) Carol moved her stuff out today.\n",
      "Monica: (to Ross) Let me get you some coffee.\n",
      "Monica: No you don't.\n",
      "Monica: Oh really, so that hysterical phone call I got from a woman at sobbing 3:00 A.M., \"I'll never have grandchildren, I'll never have grandchildren.\" was what?  A wrong number?\n",
      "Monica: Rachel?!\n",
      "Monica: (pointing at Rachel) De-caff. (to All) Okay, everybody, this is Rachel, another Lincoln High survivor. (to Rachel) This is everybody, this is Chandler, and Phoebe, and Joey, and- you remember my brother Ross?\n",
      "Monica: So you wanna tell us now, or are we waiting for four wet bridesmaids?\n",
      "Monica: Who wasn't invited to the wedding.\n",
      "Monica: Now I'm guessing that he bought her the big pipe organ, and she's really not happy about it.\n",
      "Monica: Well, I guess we've established who's staying here with Monica...\n",
      "Monica: Just breathe, breathe.. that's it. Just try to think of nice calm things...\n",
      "Monica: Okay, look, this is probably for the best, y'know? Independence. Taking control of your life.  The whole, 'hat' thing.\n",
      "Monica: Joey, stop hitting on her! It's her wedding day!\n",
      "Monica: Oh God, is it 6:30?  Buzz him in!\n",
      "Monica: Maybe. Joey: Wait. Your 'not a real date' tonight is with Paul the Wine Guy?\n",
      "Monica: Yes!\n",
      "Monica: Rach, wait, I can cancel...\n",

      "Monica: Hi, come in! Paul, this is.. (They are all lined up next to the door.)... everybody, everybody, this is Paul.\n",
      "Monica: Okay, umm-umm, I'll just--I'll be right back, I just gotta go ah, go ah...\n",
      "Monica: Change!  Okay, sit down. (Shows Paul in) Two seconds.\n",
      "Monica: (yelling from the bedroom) Shut up, Joey!\n",

      "Monica: -leg?\n",
      "Monica: You actually broke her watch?  Wow!  The worst thing I ever did was, I-I shredded by boyfriend's favorite bath towel.\n",

      "Monica: What?..... What, you wanna spell it out with noodles?\n",
      "Monica: Oh, so there is gonna be a fifth date?\n",
      "Monica: Yeah... yeah, I think there is. -What were you gonna say?\n",
      "Monica: (spitting out her drink in shock) Oh God, oh God, I am sorry... I am so sorry...\n",
      "Monica: I know being spit on is probably not what you need right now. Um... how long?\n",

      "Monica: Stop!\n",
      "Monica: We'll talk later.\n",
      "Monica: Shut up, and put my table back.\n",
      "Monica: Yeah, we all have jobs. See, that's how we buy stuff.\n",
      "Monica: Oh wait, wait, unless you happened to catch the Reruns' production of Pinocchio, at the little theater in the park.\n",
      "Monica: So how you doing today? Did you sleep okay? Talk to Barry? I can't stop smiling.\n",
      "Monica: I know, he's just so, so... Do you remember you and Tony DeMarco?\n",
      "Monica: Well, it's like that. With feelings.\n",
      "Monica: Big time!\n",
      "Monica: I think we are getting a little ahead of selves here. Okay. Okay. I am just going to get up, go to work and not think about him all day. Or else I'm just gonna get up and go to work.\n",
      "Monica: What for?\n",
      "Monica: Hey Frannie, welcome back! How was Florida?\n",
      "Monica: How do you do that?\n",

      "Monica: You mean you know Paul like I know Paul?\n",
      "Monica: Why?! Why? Why, why would anybody do something like that?\n",

      "Monica: Is it me? Is it like I have some sort of beacon that only dogs and men with severe emotional problems can hear?\n",
      "Monica: I just thought he was nice, y'know?\n",
      "Monica: How'd you pay for them?\n",
      "Monica: And who pays for that?\n",

      "Monica: All right, you ready?\n",
      "Monica: You can, I know you can!\n",
      "Monica:  Rachel!  That was a library card!\n",
      "Monica: Welcome to the real world! It sucks. You're gonna love it!\n",
      "Monica: Well, that's it (To Ross) You gonna crash on the couch?\n",
      "Monica: You be okay?\n",
